            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Friends, and Country men all,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen I seriously consider the present Calm and Quiet, the great Peace and Plenty that is in this Nation, on the one hand; and when I reflect and look back on the late impetuous Storms of Plague, Sword and Fire, that did afflict us on the other; methinks, it calls for more then ordinary praise and thanks to be returned to the Lord. Oh, <hi>Friends, Friends,</hi> retire to the Witness of God in you, and that will give you a true sence of the Mercies of God to you; I cannot, methinks, but look back on this outward Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of this Nation, from those dreadfull Judgments wherewith we were so lately afflicted, the sence whereof is still springing up in me: How did the Plague and Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence sweep away thousands, and tens of thousands from this great City, and many other parts and places of this Nation? how many were bereaved of their Children, of their Parents, of their Kindred, of their near and dear Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? and how near and dear did the sence thereof go to their hearts? But when that Judgment seemed to abate, and go over, how did people begin to be unsensible again, and to harden their hearts again? and as the Psalmist faith of <hi>Israel</hi> of old, <hi>They soon forgat his Works:</hi> But how did the Lord again awaken them with that amazing and stupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgment of the conflagration, and burning of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (a Judgment, for the greatness, and dreadfulness thereof (I think) without all paralel) the stately Buildings and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:205219:3"/>costly Structures that were then turned into Ashes, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all its outward beauty and splendor, and consuming much of the Wealth and Merchandize thereof; this loud Cry of the Lord was again to humble us, and to bring us to hear his Voice, and to answer his Requirings of us, as when he led the <hi>Israelites</hi> of old through the Wilderness, it is said, he did it <hi>to humble them, and to prove them:</hi> Indeed, this Judgment was very terrible, a wonder, nay, an amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all the Christian World, so called, to have so great a City so soon destroyed and swallowed up by devouring Flames, notwithstanding all the numberless numbers of the People, with all their Strength, Power, Arts and Engines of the Inhabitants thereof, that could not in the lest abate the rage and fury thereof, until the Power of the Lord was seen in setting bounds to the raging thereof, and staying the surious Flames of this devouring Fire; Methinks this second Judgment should quite have allayed all the Pomp and Pride that could be imagined in the hearts or heads of the Spectators, or Sufferers in it; and indeed, no doubt the Rod had its voice, and some were called by it, but soon did the generallity of people, and professors too vaunt and pride themselves out of their former ruins, as if they would dare the Almighty to try another combat with them, so that the Lord might say, as he once did by the Prophet <hi>Amos, I have overthrown some of you, as I did</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>and pluckt you as brands out of the Fire, and yet you have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to me saith the Lord:</hi> Indeed, the sad consequence of this Judgment, accompanied with a third, namely, that dreadfull Naval War, with our neighbouring Nations of <hi>Dutch, Danish</hi> and <hi>French</hi> was very terrible, so that almost all hearts seemed to be much astonished, the fears of Fire, and the many accidental Fires which then happened, with the great rumours of the Enemies Power, when approaching
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:205219:3"/>and drawing near our own Harbors was very dismal, so that all faces seemed to gather paleness, and every mans loyns to loose, having danger from dispitefull men at home, and potent Enemies abroad, and the Sword devouring many in that Naval conflict; besides the great burden of Taxes which this War procured, caused great consternation of Spirit; so that they that have any memory, or true sence thereof cannot but say, <hi>The dread thereof was beyond the Mouth or Pen of man to declare.</hi> But now after all these Judgments, when there seemed no safety to him that went forth, nor to him that stayed at home; I say, after all these Judgments, and impetuous Storms, to have the bright side of the Cloud to appear; to have Peace and Plenty, Fulness and Quietness, Freedom and Liberty, all spiritual and temporal Blessings accompanied together, and that not attained by any humane might or force, but by the secret Power of the Almighty, to have all fears and storms blown over, and <hi>every man to sit under his own Vine, and under his own Fig-tree, and no man to rise up to make him afraid:</hi> Methinks it calls for high praises to the Lord, and for every one to answer his requirings of them, to improve the Talent which he hath given every one to profit with, <hi>he hath shewed thee O man what is good, to do Justly, love Mercy and walk humbly with thy God:</hi> O methinks, how can vain men forget this love of the Lord unto them!</p>
            <p>Oh, <hi>Friends,</hi> out of my bowels of affection to you that have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>sted of this Love of the Lord, in a measure inwardly and outwardly; this love of Christ constrains me to call upon you to retire, and consider your ways and your doings that have not been good, and return to the Lord, <hi>for he it is that hath wounded, and healed, that hath killed and made alive.</hi> Oh, my <hi>Friends,</hi> I cannot but be grieved, and my Life is grieved in me, and my Bowels are pained to see the great Vanity,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:205219:4"/>Luxury, Pride and Excess that is in the Nation after so great a Deliverance, as if (like <hi>Israel</hi> of old) <hi>Ye were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to do all these Abominations:</hi> Surely, if ye do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto the Lord, <hi>He will recover his Corn, his Oyl, his Wool, and Flax of ye again:</hi> Certainly, <hi>He will come upon ye as a Bear robbed of her Whelps;</hi> the Lord hath sent chosen Messengers among you, that have cried loud in your Streets, to bring you down to his Witness in you, <hi>that you may know your Teacher that shall not be removed into a Corner any more:</hi> Oh, Friends, <hi>Let not Wisdom cry at the corners of your Streets, and you stop your ears, charm the Charmer never so wisely!</hi> O now therefore <hi>Hearken, and hear his Reproof, hear, that your Souls may live; and be willing and obedient, that so you may eat the good of the Land;</hi> for surely the Lord's Love is great unto you, to give you this glorious Day of Visitation once more, and that in so high and eminent a manner: Oh! do not do as those of old, of whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Nehemiah</hi> complains, <hi>He gave them his good Spirit to instruct them, but they rebelled against it;</hi> indeed great is the rebellion of this Nation at this day: I well know indeed great is the Profession at this time, and many are the Forms, and Ways of Worship that are set up, multitudes of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and many that cry, Lo here, and Lo there, <hi>But what means the lowing of the Oxen, and the bleating of the Sheep?</hi> Where is the Odedience that the Lord requires? Where is the holy Life, and the humble Conversation? may not the Lord [when he stands up to plead and judge the Professors] complain as he doth by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> in his 3d chapter? Is there not the same Uncharitableness, the same Houghty Carriage and Gaudy Fashions among you, as among those you separate from? surely, I think, it is too obvious to every observing Eye, and therefore the Lord may well send the same punishments, in turning the well set Hair into Baldness,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:205219:4"/>in giving Burning instead of Beauty, and instead of a Girdle a Rent, and stain the Glory of all your proud and lofty Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations; some indeed there are in whose hearts is a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and Uprightness towards the Lord, who yet are feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the barren Mountains, who in due time shall be brought to the true Shepherd and right Sheep-fold, where they shall feed and lie down in Peace: Surely now is the day which the Lord by the Prophet spake of; <hi>His Rest shall be Glorious, and upon all their Glory shall be a defence;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath the Lord sent forth many a Messenger, whose work hath been to gather you into the Life and Love of God, where you may be kept safe, when Stormes and Tempests shall arise; indeed it is Summer now, but Winter will come again, and storms will come again, and Persecution will come again: Oh, now therefore consider the dealings of the Lord with you! oh, you of this Nation, methinks, you should not forget how wonderfull the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in out age and time! so as he hath not done in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages before; how he sufferred a Sword to pass thorow the Land, and caused Peace again; changed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Governors, emptying from Vessel to Vessel, and still by reason of Transgression, how hath Judgments followed us? that dreadfull Pestilence, and consuming Fire, with the fears that accompanied them, laying dread and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror almost upon all hearts; and now the Lord in tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy hath once more visited us again, and that with so much peace and plenty to this great City, so lately much depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and so greatly consumed by the aforesaid Judgments, now again so much erected, so numerously inhabited, and so greatly encreased in Wealth and Merchandise; and above all, so much force and compulsion of Worship, in a manner, for a season laid aside, every man enjoying Freedom: I say, all these things considered, the deep sence and weight of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:205219:5"/>them lying very heavy upon me, I am constrained to send forth these few Lines, to require you to prize this Love of the Lord to you, and mind this day of your Visitation, which else will soon hasten over you; remember the words of our Saviour, <hi>To whom much is given, much will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;</hi> and do not spend your time and treasure in Pride and Vanity; let not the voice of the Oppressed, nor cry of the Needy be heard any more; remember the doom of <hi>Sodom and Gomorrah,</hi> Cities seated in a fruitfull soil; remember the Riches of <hi>Tyre,</hi> that abounded in all Wealth and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise, as well as you: nay, <hi>Remember</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>my Place which was in</hi> Shiloe, <hi>where I set my Name at the first, and see what I did to it, for the wickedness of my People:</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of these, &amp; many other Examples of God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Sin, and for Transgression should be of moment to us; O the weighty consideration of these things! that the Lord should exercise so many dreadfull Judgments in the midst of us, and we remain standing Monuments of his Mercy at this day, that after so great a Storm of dreadfull Judgments in this Nation, so great a calm of Peace and Safety should arise: Oh the true sence of these things might humble us, and make us bow down before the Lord, who hath not left himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Witness in every heart and mind! but if yet you will walk contrary to him, (and pass this glorious day of Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over) he will walk contrary unto you, and bring greater and severer Judgments upon you for the same; in Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony whereof is this given forth,</p>
